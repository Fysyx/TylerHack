Java:
CircleSquareNeuralNet - I created and trained a neural network (using FANN) to recognize squares and circles in a given binary image.
GraphSearch - Created a testing ground for different graph search algorithms.
SocketServerTerminal - Quick app to be able to receive TCP connects and be able to send/receive data via the terminal.
TwoDimensionPathfinding - App to visualize and analyze two dimension pathfinding algorithms. Currently only A* and Dijkstra's are implemented.

C#:
InputManager - I developed an input manager to easily map key and mouse buttons using the XNA framework.
